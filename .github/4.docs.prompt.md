# Comprehensive Documentation for Weather CLI App

## Objective
Create thorough documentation for the "weather" CLI application. This includes updating the `README.md`, adding inline code documentation, and establishing guidelines for logging and error messaging.

## 1. README.md Enhancements

The `README.md` file should be the central source of information for users and developers. Ensure it is well-structured and includes the following sections:

### 1.1. Overview
   - Briefly describe what the "weather" app does.
   - Highlight its key features (e.g., current weather, location lookup).

### 1.2. Features
   - List the main commands (`where-is`, `current`) and their functionalities.

### 1.3. Installation
   - **From Source/GitHub:**
     - Instructions to clone the repository.
     - Steps to install dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
     - How to install the package locally (e.g., `python3 setup.py install` or `pip install .`).
   - **From GitHub Packages (if applicable after CI/CD setup):**
     - Instructions on how to install the package from GitHub Packages using pip.
     - Mention any necessary pip configuration for accessing GitHub Packages.

### 1.4. Configuration (if any)
   - Detail any required configuration steps (e.g., setting API keys if a non-keyless API was chosen, though the preference is for keyless).
   - How to manage configuration (e.g., environment variables, config files).

### 1.5. Usage
   - Provide clear examples for each command:
     - `weather where-is --zipcode <zipcode>`
     - `weather where-is`
     - `weather current --zipcode <zipcode>`
     - `weather current`
   - Show example outputs for each command.
   - Explain all available options and arguments.

### 1.6. Development
   - **Setting up a Development Environment:**
     - Recommended Python version.
     - Creating a virtual environment.
     - Installing development dependencies (including `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `flake8`, etc., from `requirements.txt` or a `dev-requirements.txt`).
   - **Running Tests:**
     - Command to run the test suite (e.g., `pytest`).
   - **Coding Standards:**
     - Briefly mention any coding style guides followed (e.g., PEP 8).
     - Instructions for running linters/formatters (e.g., `flake8 .`).
   - **Contributing:**
     - Guidelines for contributing (e.g., fork and pull request model).
     - How to report bugs or suggest features.

### 1.7. Building and Packaging
   - Instructions on how to build the source distribution and wheel:
     - `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`

### 1.8. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
   - Briefly explain that the project uses GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and release.
   - Include the workflow status badge:
     `[![CI/CD](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)`
     (Instruct to replace `<OWNER>` and `<REPO>`).

### 1.9. Troubleshooting
   - Common issues and their solutions.
   - How to enable debug logging for more detailed output.

## 2. Inline Code Documentation

Ensure the Python code is well-documented internally.

### 2.1. Docstrings
   - **Modules:** Every `.py` file should start with a module-level docstring explaining its purpose and contents.
   - **Classes:** All classes should have docstrings describing their purpose, attributes, and methods.
   - **Functions and Methods:**
     - All public functions and methods must have docstrings.
     - Docstrings should explain what the function/method does, its parameters (including types), what it returns (including type), and any exceptions it might raise.
     - Follow a consistent docstring format (e.g., Google style, reStructuredText).

### 2.2. Comments
   - Use inline comments (`#`) to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.
   - Avoid over-commenting simple code. Comments should add clarity, not noise.
   - Mark `TODO` or `FIXME` comments appropriately if there are known issues or pending work.

## 3. Logging Strategy

Implement an effective logging strategy using Python's `logging` module.

### 3.1. Configuration
   - Set up a basic logging configuration in the main CLI entry point (e.g., in `cli.py`).
   - Allow users to control log verbosity (e.g., via a `--verbose` or `--debug` flag).
   - Default log level should be `INFO`. `DEBUG` level for verbose output.

### 3.2. Usage
   - **INFO:** Log general information about the app's execution (e.g., "Fetching weather for zipcode XXXXX", "Determining current location").
   - **DEBUG:** Log detailed information useful for debugging (e.g., API request URLs, raw API responses, intermediate calculation steps).
   - **WARNING:** Log potential issues or unexpected situations that don't prevent the current operation from completing (e.g., "API response took longer than expected", "Could not geolocate, falling back to default").
   - **ERROR:** Log errors that prevent an operation from completing (e.g., "Invalid zipcode format", "API request failed", "Failed to determine current location").
   - **CRITICAL:** Log severe errors that might lead to application termination.

### 3.3. Formatting
   - Log messages should be clear and informative.
   - Include timestamps and log levels in the output.
   - Example format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - LEVEL - Message`

## 4. Error Messaging and Handling

Improve user-facing error messages and internal error handling.

### 4.1. User-Facing Messages
   - Error messages displayed to the user should be:
     - **Clear and Concise:** Easy to understand.
     - **Actionable:** If possible, suggest what the user can do to fix the issue (e.g., "Invalid zipcode. Please provide a 5-digit US zipcode.").
     - **Polite:** Avoid technical jargon where possible.
   - Use Click's error handling capabilities (e.g., `click.ClickException`, `ctx.fail()`) for consistent error reporting from commands.

### 4.2. Exception Handling
   - Implement `try-except` blocks for operations that can fail (e.g., API calls, file I/O, location services).
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than generic `Exception`.
   - Log errors with stack traces for debugging (at `DEBUG` or `ERROR` level) but present a user-friendly message to the console.
   - Define custom exceptions if appropriate for application-specific error conditions.

## Files to Update/Create
- `README.md`
- All Python source files (`.py`) for inline documentation.
- `weather/cli.py` (or main entry point) for logging setup.
- Potentially new modules for custom exceptions or logging configuration if deemed necessary.
